# Introduction

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) aims to extend
Bayesian posterior inference to problems where no explicit likelihood function
is available. Instead, inference relies on some kind of simulation mechanism.
This mechanism can be obtained from a data generating model but it could also
be a black box without explicit knowledge of the data generating mechanism.
The parameters contained in the model are subject to inference.
Based on @Barthelme2014a
